      <h2>My First Day at The Iron Yard</h2>
      <p>
        I feel my first day went pretty well. I still need to get comfortable with Git, but I don't feel lost in HTML or CSS.
        I attribute that to the prework being fantastic. I was able to complete the first 2 levels rather quickly.
        I only made it through about half of level 3. For the first 2 levels, I was able to do it while on the job working security
        (not much happens on 3rd shift in Nashville). Trying to complete prework from home with a 2 year old and a 2 month old is...
        challenging! I much preferred the videos in Code School, but Code Academy provided a good base. I was looking forward to Treehouse,
        but simply ran out of time. I will try to go back and take their courses too. You can never learn too much.
      </p>
      <p>
        I removed the Lorem text from this section. I didn't really provide any new content per se, but the lorem is gone.
        Like the lorem, this is pretty much placeholder text that acts as filler. Like political promises, it adds some volume
        , but no <em>real<em> content.
